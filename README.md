Using Rust to blink an LED on an embedded device

This example is mainly copied from the great Rust Embedded [Cortex-M Quickstart](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart)
and Jesse Braham's article [Embedded Rust: From Zero to Blinky](https://beta7.io/posts/embedded-rust-from-zero-to-blinky.html)
and tweaked for the STM32F446RE of the NUCLEO-F446RE board.
